# Airline-Rewards-Program
The RewardsProgram class shows the user the perks and miles required for each tier:
For each tier, you need to represent the miles a passenger needs to belong to the tier, 
and the perks (as a descriptive string) of belonging to a certain tier.

For RewardsMember class, the program is giving the user a querier to view their account information, which includes: 
• Miles accumulated in the current year. 
• Total miles accumulated since joining the rewards program.
• Join date of the rewards program.
• Current reward tier, based on miles accumulated from the previous year. 
• Given a prior year, the reward tier the passenger belonged to. For
example, if 2018 is entered for the year, then the tier would be based on miles accumulated in 2017.
